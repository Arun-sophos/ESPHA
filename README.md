ESPHA ARDUINO CODE
Here is my selfwritten arduino code communicating with my IoT Website https://espha.000webhostapp.com (Not so pretty Looking).
# Version 1.0
Worked on several functions to send request to server, and controling an RGB Led.
Here ESP8266 is simply requesting webserver and getting data.(Unable to port forward in my college)So,Not able to make arduino webserver.
Have a look on main code ESP8266_BASE
